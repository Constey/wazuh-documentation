Settings
========

Every cloud environment is configured based on specific settings that define its limitations, capabilities, and pricing. We offer six available settings, including four basic settings and two advanced settings. The advanced settings are automatically calculated based on the basic settings but can be modified if desired.

To monitor the behavior of your environment and check if the configured values of the settings are being reached, see the :doc:`Monitor usage section </cloud-service/your-environment/monitor-environment-usage>`. section.

Understanding environment settings
----------------------------------

Below, we provide a detailed explanation of each setting.

.. _cloud_settings_active_agents:

Active agents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This basic setting defines the maximum number of active Wazuh agents that the environment can support. Please note that while it is possible to register an unlimited number of Wazuh agents, the number of active agents is limited by this setting.

If the maximum number of active agents is reached, the environment may start to malfunction, causing instability with agent connections. While the system can tolerate temporarily exceeding the limit of active agents, appropriate measures will be taken if the situation persists.


.. _cloud_settings_indexed_data:

Indexed data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The indexed data, previously known as hot storage, includes the data available on the Wazuh WUI, which corresponds to the information indexed by Wazuh. This information becomes searchable and analyzable as soon as Wazuh ingests and indexes the events sent by the agents.

Two settings define the behavior of the indexed data:

- Indexed data retention: It determines the maximum duration for which data remains indexed. This is a basic setting.

- Indexed data capacity: It defines the maximum size, in bytes, of the indexed data. This setting is equivalent to what was previously called a "tier." This is an advanced setting, and the interface provides a suggestion when selecting the Indexed data retention.

Data remains indexed until either the indexed data retention or the indexed data capacity is reached. In other words, once either of the settings' values is reached, data rotation will occur (removing the oldest data) until the settings' conditions are met.


.. _cloud_settings_archived_data:

Archived data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This basic setting, previously known as cold storage, determines the duration for which the analyzed data generated by Wazuh is stored in an AWS S3 bucket for long-term storage purposes. Unlike the indexed data, this data is not searchable or analyzable. It simply consists of a collection of compressed files.

When the specified time is reached, data outside that time range will be deleted.

.. _cloud_support_type:

Support plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This setting indicates whether the support level is premium or standard.

.. _cloud_settings_data_ingestion_rate:

Average/Peak EPS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It represents the maximum number of events per second (EPS) that the environment can analyze. This is an advanced setting, and the interface provides a suggestion when selecting the Active agents setting.

If the ingestion rate is exceeded, events will start to queue. However, if the queue becomes full, the incoming events will be discarded, which may lead to potential event loss. The queuing mechanism is automatically managed by the cloud service, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

The environment will be configured with the `limits eps option <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/global.html#limits>`_ using the following parameters:

- timeframe = 1 seconds
- maximum = Average/Peak EPS setting / number of server nodes

The number of server nodes is automatically determined by the cloud service based on the workload. For instance, if the Average/Peak EPS setting is 900 EPS and there is a cluster of 2 nodes at the current time, each node can process up to 450 events per second.

.. _cloud_settings_adjust:

Adjusting environment settings
------------------------------

Managing your environment settings is crucial to meeting your evolving needs and optimizing the performance of your cloud environment. While some settings can be determined upfront, such as the number of active agents, indexed data retention, archived data, and support plan, it's important to note that these requirements may change over time.

Additionally, advanced settings may be more challenging to determine in advance. While the interface provides recommendations based on our experience, your specific workload may differ. That's why we highly recommend deploying, monitoring, and adjusting the settings as needed to align with your evolving requirements.

To effectively monitor and adapt your environment, you have the option to modify your settings by opening a support ticket. Here's how the process works:

- Upgrading a setting: If you need to raise a setting, you will be charged a prorated amount based on the remaining time in your billing cycle. The change will be implemented immediately after the payment is made. Please note that your next billing cycle will reflect the increased cost of the enhancement.

- Downgrading a setting: If you want to lower a setting, the change will take effect in the next billing cycle, resulting in a reduced cost.

Before any changes or payments are made, we will confirm the adjustments with you to ensure accuracy and alignment with your requirements.

By monitoring your environment and making necessary adjustments to the settings, you can ensure that your cloud environment remains optimized and aligned with your evolving needs.
