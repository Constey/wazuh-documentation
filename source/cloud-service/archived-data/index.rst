Archived data
=============

Wazuh provides two types of storage for your data: indexed data (formerly known as hot storage) and archived data (formerly known as cold storage).

When Wazuh ingests and indexes events from agents, the data becomes searchable and analyzable in the Wazuh WUI. This information is stored in indexed data, which is limited by your :ref:`indexed data retention and indexed data capacity <cloud_settings_indexed_data>` (formerly known as tier) settings. Simultaneously, the data is sent to archived data with a maximum delay of 30 minutes after initial processing by Wazuh. Archived data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket, allowing you to store logs for extended periods and meet compliance requirements. Additionally, you can reindex the data to other environments for further investigations.

To better understand how data storage works in Wazuh, let's examine an example environment:

Your environment is configured with the following settings:

- Indexed data retention: 3 months
- Indexed data capacity (formerly known as tier): 100 GB
- Archived data: 1 year

Assuming that Wazuh ingests 5GB of data daily, with 20% of events generating alerts, it indexes 1GB per day. In this scenario, the indexed data can retain alerts for up to 100 days (1GB per day - 100GB), but it will be rotated to maintain only 3 months of data as specified in the indexed data retention setting. However, all information from the past year is still accessible in the archived data according to the archived data setting.

This configuration ensures that recent alerts are readily available in the indexed data, while older data is securely stored in the archived data for compliance and historical purposes.
